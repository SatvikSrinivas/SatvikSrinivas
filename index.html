    <h1>The 2x2 Rubiks Cube Solver</h1>
    <p>The 2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver is a program intended to help beginners learn how to solve the 2x2 Rubik's Cube. Users will be able to input what their physical cube looks like and the program will graphically represent it in 3D on the screen and solve it. The program will not only solve the cube and give the user the answer as to what moves to execute in order to solve it but it will offer a step by step solution explaining each and every step along the way. The program aims to teach the user how to solve the cube rather than simply solving it for them.</p>
